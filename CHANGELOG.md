# Changelog

All notable changes to the DDEX Suite project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### 🔄 BREAKING: Partner Presets Refactor
- **Removed speculative platform presets**: All presets without public DDEX specifications have been removed
- **Generic industry-standard presets added**: New baseline DDEX-compliant presets (`audio_album`, `audio_single`, `video_single`, `compilation`)
- **YouTube presets retained**: Only platform with publicly available DDEX documentation
- **Enhanced custom preset framework**: New `CustomPresetBuilder` for creating organization-specific configurations
- **Comprehensive migration guide**: Step-by-step guide for updating existing configurations

### Added
- **Comment retention engine**: Full XML comment preservation throughout parse → build round-trip
- **Position-aware comments**: Comments track their relationship to parent elements (before/after/inside)
- **Custom preset templates**: Well-documented templates for creating platform-specific presets
- **Preset architecture documentation**: Complete guide to the new preset system philosophy and usage

### Migration Required
- Replace `spotify_album` → `audio_album` + custom configuration
- Replace `apple_music_43` → `audio_album` + custom configuration  
- Use `youtube_album`/`youtube_video` for YouTube (retained, based on public docs)
- See `docs/PRESET_MIGRATION.md` for complete migration guide
